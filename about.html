        <h3>About SocialPreneur Lab</h3>

        The SocialPreneur Lab is a program that has combined student fundraising and community
        service into an alternative extracurricular and practicum of social entrepreneurship for youth.
        Similar to little league sports or music recitals, the organization aims to build students’ business
        acumen and entrepreneurial acuity through practice and experience.
        In the lab, students are given the opportunity to work through the entire business development
        process—from business planning, marketing, raising capital, application, generating revenue, and
        scaling—to launch one of our social enterprise toolkits, including agribusiness, upcycling, and
        microfinance.

        The crowdfunding platform and e-commerce site, exclusive to our SocialPreneurs, also gives
        students the opportunity to learn about entrepreneurship through doing!

        <h3>About Jamela Peterson</h3>
        Jamela Peterson is a social entrepreneur and global citizen, leveraging social enterprises to build a
        greater humanity.
        She earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from Davidson College and was a recipient of the
        Arnold Snider full-merit scholarship. Along with a fellow Davidson student, she co-founded a tech
        startup called RoomMe.Co to help young professionals find compatible roommates. Jamela has
        also worked extensively in the social sector from neighborhood revitalization projects with
        Habitat for Humanity to community health assessments at the Sedgwick County Health
        Department.
        In 2014, a business development internship with Afara Global sparked and shaped her passion for
        social entrepreneurship. In this position, she traveled to Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa to
        study social enterprises and innovation in hubs and accelerators.
        Based on this experience, she built a curriculum and workbook geared towards K-12 students to
        teach Social Entrepreneurship and Financial Literacy and founded in 2016 the SocialPreneur Lab
        to give students exposure to entrepreneurship and running their own business. Her aim is to
        empower youth and marginalized communities to become global leaders and stakeholders of
        social change.
